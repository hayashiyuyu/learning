# adjective(2)

## Study for today

### 1. comparative by peer comparison

- （not）as + 原级 + as

- （not）so + 原级 + as

  意思都表示为“和……（不）一样”

### 2. multiple

- if the multiple >= 3 

A + 谓语 + 数字 + times + as + 原级 + as + B

> e.g. The red ruler is three times as long as the yellow one

A + 谓语 + 数字 + times + 比较级 + than + B

> e.g. The red ruler is three times longer than the yellow one

- if the multiple < 3 

A + 谓语 + once/twice + as + 原级 + as + B

> e.g. The red ruler is twice as long as the yellow one

A + 谓语 + once/twice + 比较级 + than + B

> e.g. The red ruler is twice longer than the yellow one

PS : we usually omit the "once", because the "as + 原级 + as" have already had once means

### use the "so" and "such" to modify the adj

- so + adj + a/an + n(noun)

> e.g. You are so beautiful a girl

- such + a/an + adj + n
 
> e.g. You are such a beautiful girl

## find something in question

- We can add some words to modify the comparative degree

  such as: much 、a lot 、still etc.

> e.g., much more difficult

  the mean is "难很多."
  
- case the position of  "as" and "the" when we write the question

- the + 比较级 ， the + 比较级

  "the + 比较级， the + 比较级" is the focus sentence, we usually tested it in test

  the more , the more

  the harder , the more
  
- if we add the noun in multiple, we should put the noun behind the second "as"

## issue

那个语法是学了，上课讲的考点也会了，但是做题好像没有全掌握，发现很多题目，有很多生词。
我现在打算按照可浩教的方法，去做阅读题，然后标出生词，每天背一点。 
然后日常的课应该也要去看，不学也不太现实.
很多的题目是因为理解错误才导致做错的
感觉目前最大的问题还是词汇那边
