# organic chemistry

learn organic chemistry and organic compound concept; understand the chemistry theory for hybrid orbital

## organic compound

### concept

- organic compound : hydrocarbon and their derivatives

- hydrocarbon : compounds containing only C and H elements

### characteristic (most of them but not of all)

- the complex structure and various kinds

  because of isomer
  
- soluble in organic solvents , hard to dissolve in water

  polarity substance is easily soluble in polarity solvent
  
  the non-polar substance is easily soluble in the non-polar solvent
  
> water is the polarity solvent , and most organic solvents are non-polar solvents , so most of the organic compounds are non-polar substances
  
- organic compound

  melting point and boiling point are a little low
  
  easy to burn , so the stability is poor
  
  not easy to conduct electricity

- inorganic compound

  melting point and boiling opint are a little high
  
  generally non-flammable or difficult to burn
  
  conductive in solution or molten state
  
- the response is slow and complex , and often accompanied by side chemistry reaction

  chemistry reactions are marked with arrows
  
  indicate the reaction conditions
  
  write the primary response , no need to balance chemistry equations
  
## organic chemistry

### concept

- learn the chemistry of organic compound

## structure of organic compounds

### structural features

- carbon is the core element in organic compounds

  the valency of the carbon is 4
  
  so the carbon atom has four covalent bonds
  
- bonding method

  single bond 、 double bond 、 triple bond
  
- connection type

  chain or ring

I am not master the hybrid orbital yet , but I plan to study and write about it in tomorrow
