# lesson 1 - a private conversation

## 摘要写作

Last week, the writer went to the theatre.
But he didn't enjoy the play, 
because a young man and a young woman were sitting behind him. 
They were talking so loudly that he couldn't hear the actors. 
He turned round and said, " I can't hear a word ". 
But the young man said, " This is a private conversation".
