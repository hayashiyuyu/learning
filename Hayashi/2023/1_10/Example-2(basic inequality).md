# Example-2(basic inequality)

### A known x and y are positive numbers, to prove:

> - if x * y equals to value P, when x = y, there is a minimum 2sqrt(P) of x + y.

> - If x + y equals to value S, when x = y, there is a maximum 1/4 * S^2 of x * y.

## Step

Because x and y are positive numbers, so we could learn:

```x+y/2 >= sqrt(xy)```

When x * y = P:

```x+y/2 >= sqrt(P)```

So when x = y, the minimum of x+y/2 is sqrt(P);

----

```sqrt(xy) <= S/2```

from the formula above we could learn:

```xy <= S^2/4```

----
