# Example-1(basic inequality)

## Question

```
When x > 0, find the minimum value of x + 1/x.
```

## Step

What if you want to find the minimum of x + 1/x. You can simply use basic inequality.
It goes like this:
> basic inequality:sqrt(ab) <= a+b/2

```
a = x ;
b = 1/x ;
sqrt(x*1/x) <= x+1/x/2 ;
2*sqrt(x*1/x) <= x+1/x ;
2 <= x+1/x ;
so the minimum of x+1/x is 2.
```
