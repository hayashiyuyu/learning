# Asahi liunx

## problem

- now asahi linux is installed successfully in M1 Macbook Air. But it still cannot run open euler with Xfce.

the output :

```
qemu-system-riscv64:Display 'sdl' is not available.
```

- Asahi linux cannot use Clash for Windows.

> these problem still exist, there is no good way to solve it.

## What I have done

> try to make SDL2 on the asahi linux.
> installed qemu-system-riscv on asahi linux.

## Plan

> Gonna use another machine which runing on x86 architecture to replace the M1 Mac.
