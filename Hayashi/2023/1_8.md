# VNC on OE

Use the [scrpit]() to boot openeuler , and you can see the VNC port on terminal:

```
vCPU Cores:       8
Memory:           8
Disk Path:        openEuler-22.03-V2-xfce-qemu-preview.qcow2
Kernal Path:      fw_payload_oe_qemuvirt.elf
BIOS Path:        none
SSH Port:         12055
VNC Port:         12056

Use the following command to connect SSH server: ssh root@localhost -p 12055
Use the following address to connect VNC server: localhost:12056
```

and then you could copy that port and paste on VNC.

## issue

VNC could only show the desktop without sound output.
